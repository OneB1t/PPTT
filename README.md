Planning PhotoThermal Therapy 
=============================

Simulation software for effective photothermal therapy. 
Simulation consists of three parts:
1. Light propagation in biological tissues
2. Optical response of nanoparticles
3. Bioheat distribution

1. Light propagation in biological tissues
==========================================
Monte Carlo method is involved in voxel space.
